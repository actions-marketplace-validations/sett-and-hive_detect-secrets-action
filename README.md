        uses: RobertFischer/detect-secrets-action@v2.0.0
      - name: Commit back .secrets.baseline (if it was missing)
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4

## Environment Variables

| Key  | Value Description | Default Value |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| `DS_ADDL_ARGS` | Additional arguments to pass to the `detect-secrets` binary | No additional arguments (ie: the empty string) |
| `DS_REQUIRE_BASELINE` | If set to anything other than `0`, we will fail the test if there is no baseline file | `0` (ie: don't require baseline) ]

## Usage Notes

If this action runs and does not see a `detect-secrets` baseline file at `.secrets.baseline` in the root of the repo, then the action will generate that baseline file for you.
If you don't commit that file back, then this action is effectively an expensive no-op. The sample configuration above demonstrates how to commit back using the
(`git-auto-commit`)[https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-auto-commit] action.
